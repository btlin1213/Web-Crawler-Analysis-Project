# Web-Crawler-Analysis-Project
**note**: All source code are written in Python 3 and by me, completed for COMP20008 - Elements of Data Processing Project 1 in 2020 Semester 1 at The University of Melbourne. Project specifications and provided datasets are credited to the lecturers and tutors of this subject. 

# Project Overview
A web server has been setup [here](http://comp20008-jh.eng.unimelb.edu.au:9889/main/) containing a number of media reports on Tennis matches between 2004 and 2005. As a data scientist, extract information from those reports and use that information to improve the understanding of player performance. A JSON data file containing player names and key statistics is also available [here](https://github.com/btlin1213/Web-Crawler-Analysis-Project/blob/master/tennis.json).

# Project Content
1. Web crawler that scrapes data from given website. 
2. Extract player names and scores with regex.
3. Produce `.csv` file containing absolute value of game differences.
4. Produce suitable plot (bar plot) showing 5 most frequently written about players, and the number of articles written about them.
5. Produce suitable plot (scatterplot) showing average game difference for each player that has at least 1 article written about them.
6. 3-4 page report to communicate the process and activities undertaken in the project, the analysis, and some limitations.

# Final Note
The `.csv` and `.png` files in this repository are the outputs of running `script.py`. Simply `pip install` the dependencies listed at the top of `script.py` and run the script to get the outputs on your local machine.
